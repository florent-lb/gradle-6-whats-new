# What's New In Gradle 6.0?

**Demo Project**: [demos/hello-gradle-6](demos/hello-gradle-6) 

Gradle 6.0 is the culmination of several years of innovative improvements in Dependency
Management. Embracing the idea that there is more to software composition and reuse than
just putting a set of jar files on the classpath, Gradle now offers a new metadata format
to richly define software components that are often made up of multiple files, different
variants and specific constraints on their dependencies. 

In addition, Gradle 6.0 adds several other features that will help improve your overall
Developer Productivity including updates to the Worker and Tooling APIs and new cryptographic
function options for library publishers.
